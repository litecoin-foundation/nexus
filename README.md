# Nexux Wallet for Litecoin

Pay, trade & grow with Litecoin. Nexus Wallet gives you low-fee sends, private Litecoin payments, Flexa checkout, 130 + local buy options â€” all in one tap.

### Dev Instructions

Building Nexus is simple. If your system is already configured for native mobile development, or for React Native development, builiding can be done in a few simple steps.

**Required Tools:**
- Node v22+ (via nvm)
- Yarn
- Xcode
- Android Studio
- Cocoapods for iOS

**Installation Instructions:**
```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/litecoin-foundation/nexus.git
$ cd nexus
$ yarn

# ios specific
$ yarn run fetch:ios # fetches ios lndltc framework
$ yarn run pods

# android specific
$ yarn run fetch:android # fetches android lndltc framework

$ yarn start
```

You should now be able to open up the project in Android Studio or Xcode and compile a binary.

### Debugging

We reccommend using React Native DevTools for debugging the frontend. When the app is in debug mode, any Redux store updates will be printed to console.

For debugging the native side, we suggest using Xcode/Android Studio. 

Issues with lndltc can be seen by viewing the lnd debug.log in the Nexus data directory. 
For iOS viewing this requires a development build of Nexus, opening up Xcode, Window > Devices and Simulator > Select your device > right click and download the Nexus data directory.

A more indepth developer document will be provided in the future.
